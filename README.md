tercraft Core
Core mod for InterCraft 1.13.2 modpack.


### Ideas
- Missing pieces
    - [ ] Metals (ex. copper, tin) :heavy_check_mark:
    - [ ] Minerals (ex. saltpeter, salt) :heavy_check_mark:
    - [ ] Rubber
- Machines
    - [ ] PCB Work Table (PCB crafting tree step 1)
    - [ ] Soldering Station (PCB crafting tree step 2)
    - [ ] PCB Factory line (PCB crafting tree step 1 & 2 automated with program)
    - [ ] (Placeable) PCB (logic gates)
    
    *Can be configurated however you want to make 1x1 logic gates (AND NAND OR XOR, etc). Can be used in crafting ex. [OpenComputers](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/opencomputers).*
- Gen.
    - [ ] Ores ([hard](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/harder-ores)) :heavy_check_mark:
    
    *Ores which depending on the concentration of metal inside it will vary the break time of the block and amount of ore chunks dropped.*
    - [ ] Oil
    - [ ] Minerals :heavy_check_mark:
- Compatibility
    - [ ] [OpenComputers](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/opencomputers) :heavy_check_mark:
    - [ ] [Galacticraft](https://micdoodle8.com/mods/galacticraft)
    - [ ] [Project Red](https://projectredwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page)
- Energy
    - [ ] Cables
    
    *Regular old cables taking up space. But multiple cables (and pipes) can take up the same space like [EnderIO](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/ender-io), also single cable lines can be dragged between connectors like [Immersive Engineering](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/immersive-engineering).*
    - [ ] Custom Batteries
    
    *Batteries which are modeled on real life batteries or Galvanic [Cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanic_cell) which are then placed into battery boxes to be usable in external machines.*
    - [ ] Single Use Batteries
    - [ ] [Aquaphobic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaphobia) (machines, cables without insulation, circuits, etc)
    - [ ] Generators (Water, air, geothermal, fission, steam)
    
    *I really like [ReactorCraft](https://sites.google.com/site/reikasminecraft/reactorcraft)'s way of creating multiblocks. You design the reactor yourself with pieces as indiviual blocks doing their thing. Doing that but for most of the generators where you decide how you want to build it.*
    - [ ] Unit
    
    *Custom energy unit ("ICU"?) also losely modeled after real life (not completely as to not eat too much TPS).*
